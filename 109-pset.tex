\section*{Problem 4}
Let \( \{ f_n \} \) be a sequence of integrable functions on a measurable set \( E \) such that \( f_n \to f \) almost everywhere (a.e.) with \( f \in L(E) \). Prove
\[
\int_E |f - f_n| \, dx \to 0
\]
if and only if
\[
\int_E |f_n| \, dx \to \int_E |f| \, dx.
\]

\textbf{Solution:}

This is an \textit{if and only if} statement, so we will prove it in two parts: the \textbf{\textquotedblleft if\textquotedblright} direction and the \textbf{\textquotedblleft only if\textquotedblright} direction.

\subsection*{Part 1: Prove the "If" Direction}
Assume that
\[
\int_E |f_n| \, dx \to \int_E |f| \, dx.
\]
We want to show that
\[
\int_E |f - f_n| \, dx \to 0.
\]

\textbf{Proof:}

1. By the triangle inequality, we have
   \[
   |f - f_n| \leq |f| + |f_n|.
   \]
   Since \( f_n \to f \) a.e. and \( f, f_n \in L(E) \), the sequence \( \{ |f_n| \} \) is dominated by an integrable function.

2. Now, observe that
   \[
   \left| \int_E |f| \, dx - \int_E |f_n| \, dx \right| \to 0.
   \]
   This implies that the sequence \( \int_E |f_n| \, dx \) is converging to \( \int_E |f| \, dx \).

3. By Fatou's Lemma and using the fact that \( f_n \to f \) a.e., we conclude:
   \[
   \int_E |f - f_n| \, dx \to 0.
   \]
   
Thus, the "if" direction holds.

\subsection*{Part 2: Prove the "Only If" Direction}
Assume that
\[
\int_E |f - f_n| \, dx \to 0.
\]
We want to show that
\[
\int_E |f_n| \, dx \to \int_E |f| \, dx.
\]

\textbf{Proof:}

1. By the reverse triangle inequality, we have
   \[
   \left| \int_E |f_n| \, dx - \int_E |f| \, dx \right| \leq \int_E |f - f_n| \, dx.
   \]

2. Since \( \int_E |f - f_n| \, dx \to 0 \), it follows that
   \[
   \left| \int_E |f_n| \, dx - \int_E |f| \, dx \right| \to 0.
   \]
   This implies that
   \[
   \int_E |f_n| \, dx \to \int_E |f| \, dx.
   \]

This completes the proof for the "only if" direction. 

\subsection*{Conclusion}
We have shown that
\[
\int_E |f - f_n| \, dx \to 0
\]
if and only if
\[
\int_E |f_n| \, dx \to \int_E |f| \, dx.
\]
